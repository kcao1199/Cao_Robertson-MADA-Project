	abstract = {ABSTRACT Purpose Vaccinations are reported at the state level, but services are delivered at the county level through health departments (HD). This research contributes statistical models to predict county level HPV vaccination. Methods Using a cross sectional study design, secondary data were analyzed for the years 2016–2018 for all counties of GA. Study population was male and female adolescents aged 13–17 who received the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. The number of administered HPV vaccine doses and HPV vaccination coverage rate were modeled using indicators of HD clinic access, age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, median household income, health insurance, and urban/rural residence. Results By county the number of administered HPV vaccine doses showed a statistically significant positive association with indicators of HD clinic access: public transit and the number of HD private clinics. HPV vaccination coverage showed a statistically significant negative association with White race and rural residency. Conclusion Examining Tdap vaccinated adolescents conservatively predicted HPV vaccination and controlled for multiple confounders such as vaccination ineligibility, vaccine exemption, and vaccine opposition. Within this population, public health professionals and clinicians could use these statistical models to target HPV vaccination efforts among non-Hispanic whites and rural communities at the county level.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyse progress in global vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) during the covid-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on equity.
DESIGN: Descriptive study of World Health Organization-Unicef vaccination coverage estimates.
SETTING: WHO-Unicef estimates of global, regional, and national HPV vaccination coverage, before (2010-19) and during (2020-21) the covid-19 pandemic.
PARTICIPANTS: Girls aged 9-14 years who received a HPV vaccine globally before (12.3 million in 2019) and during (2020-21) the covid-19 pandemic (10.6 million in 2021).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean programme and population adjusted coverage for first dose HPV vaccine (HPV1) by country, country income (World Bank income categories), sex, and WHO region, before (2010-19) and during (2020-21) the covid-19 pandemic, based on WHO-Unicef estimates of HPV vaccination coverage. Annual number of national HPV vaccine programme introduced since the first HPV vaccine licence was granted in 2006, based on data reported to WHO-Unicef. Number of girls vaccinated before (2019) versus during (2020-21) the covid-19 pandemic period.
RESULTS: Mean coverage of HPV vaccination programmes among girls decreased from 65\% in 2010-19 to 50\% in 2020-21 in low and middle income countries compared with an increase in high income countries from 61\% to 69\% for the same periods. Population adjusted HPV1 coverage was higher among girls in high income countries before and during the covid-19 pandemic than in girls in low and middle income countries. During the covid-19 pandemic, population adjusted HPV1 coverage among boys in high income countries was higher and remained higher than coverage among girls in low and middle income countries. Globally, 23 countries recorded a severe reduction in their HPV programme (≥50\% reduction in coverage), and another 3.8 million girls globally did not receive a HPV vaccine in countries with existing HPV vaccination programmes in 2020-21 compared with 2019. A reduction was seen in the annual rate of new introductions of national HPV vaccine programmes during 2020-21, affecting countries in all income categories, followed by an increase in introductions during 2022. During the second half of 2023, several low and middle income countries with large birth cohorts and a high relative burden of cervical cancer have yet to introduce HPV vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Although HPV vaccines have been available for more than 15 years, global HPV vaccination coverage is low. During the covid-19 pandemic period (2020-21 globally), worsening coverage, delayed introductions of national vaccine programmes, and an increase in missed girls globally (ie, girls who did not receive a HPV vaccine compared with the previous year in countries with an existing HPV vaccination programme) that disproportionately affected girls in low and middle income countries were found. Urgent and innovative recovery efforts are needed to accelerate national introduction of HPV vaccination programmes and achieve high coverage of HPV vaccination worldwide.},

Statutes and regulations relevant to the study were analyzed and coded based on their legal attributes into ten broad coding questions and several sub-questions. Of the 212 laws identified by the initial search string, 93 (43.9\%) reference HPV vaccination in statute or regulation. An additional three laws were added following subsequent review. There was a total of 52 statutes and 44 regulations from 34 states and the District of Columbia. Most laws were related to developing and distributing HPV vaccination materials for parents, and mechanisms to fund and reimburse for the vaccination. This study can be used by policymakers in jurisdictions that are considering establishing HPV vaccination promotion interventions in state law and highlighting the limited statutory and regulatory efforts that have been implemented to promote HPV vaccination.

	abstract = {School-based HPV vaccination programs have improved vaccine uptake among adolescents globally. However, school-based HPV vaccination strategies in the United States (US) have mainly focused on school-entry mandates for vaccination, which have passed in only five states/jurisdictions. Many schools and school-based health centers (SBHCs) already provide health services to medically underserved adolescents and opportunities to improve disparities in HPV vaccine education and uptake are underexplored. This qualitative study of clinic and community members assessed potential opportunities within and outside schools to increase HPV vaccination. Data were generated from a larger mixed-methods study designed to understand experiences with HPV vaccination evidence-based strategies in medically underserved communities. The parent study included interviews and focus groups conducted with clinic (providers, clinic leaders, staff) and community (racial/ethnic minority parents, advocates, payers, policy representatives) members in Los Angeles and New Jersey between December 2020-January 2022. We created a reduced dataset of text related to schools/SBHCs (30 in-depth interviews, 7 focus groups) and conducted a directed content analysis. Participants indicated that schools and SBHCs are ideal venues for reaching medically underserved adolescents experiencing barriers to primary care access. Parents/providers expressed mutual interest in HPV vaccine administration/education in schools, but some advocates/policy participants experienced challenges due to increasing politicization of vaccines. Participants highlighted policies for expanding HPV vaccine education and administration in schools, including minor consent and increasing SBHC funding for HPV vaccines. More research is needed to explore existing infrastructure, partner motivation, and opportunities to improve HPV vaccination among medically underserved adolescents within schools beyond vaccine mandates.},

Methods: We conducted clinician-to-clinician AFIX visits at 24 New York City (NYC) high-school and middle-school SBHCs with up-to-date adolescent vaccination rates below 40\%. Using NYC's immunization information system, we assessed HPV initiation and series completion rates at the time of AFIX visit and follow-up three to five months later. We analyzed responses to a questionnaire and summarized interviews to identify barriers and facilitators to HPV immunization practices and quality improvement (QI) implementation. Results: Baseline initiation and completion rates were 76\% and 43\% for high schools, and 81\% and 45\% for middle schools. SBHCs that allowed adolescent self-consent or did not require separate vaccine consent had higher baseline rates, but was not statistically significant. Barriers to series completion included challenges with scheduling and appointment compliance. At follow-up, high school SBHCs increased HPV vaccine initiation by 2.9 percentage points (p {\textless} 0.01) and series completion by 2.7 percentage points (p {\textless} 0.05). There was no statistically significant increase at middle school SBHCs. Most SBHCs (88\%) chose reminder/recall systems as a QI strategy. Fewer than half (42\%) implemented their QI strategy. Conclusions: We identified barriers to HPV vaccine series completion at our sample of SBHCs. Clinician-to-clinician AFIX visits may help improve vaccination rates and encourage providers to address barriers, including streamlining consent processes for HPV vaccination.

We assessed the association between SES, defined by an individual validated Housing-based Socioeconomic Status index (HOUSES), and HPV vaccination status.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of children/adolescents 9–17 years as of December 31, 2016, living in southeastern Minnesota by using a health-record linkage system to identify study-eligible children/adolescents, vaccination dates, and home addresses matched to HOUSES data. We analyzed the relationship between HPV vaccination status and HOUSES using multivariable Poisson regression models stratifying by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and county.

Results:
Of 20,087 study-eligible children/adolescents, 19,363 (96.4\%) were geocoded and HOUSES measures determined. In this cohort, 57.9\% did not receive HPV vaccination, 15.8\% initiated (only), and 26.3\% completed the series. HPV vaccination-initiation and completion rates increased over higher SES HOUSES quartiles (P{\textless}.001). Rates of HPV vaccination initiation versus unvaccinated increased across HOUSES quartiles in multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and county (1st quartile referent; 2nd quartile, 0.97 [0.87–1.09]; 3rd quartile, 1.05 [0.94–1.17]; 4th quartile, 1.15 [1.03–1.28]; test for trend, P=.002). HOUSES was a stronger predictor of HPV vaccination completion versus unvaccinated (1st quartile referent; 2nd quartile, 1.06 [0.96–1.16]; 3rd quartile, 1.12 [1.03–1.23]; 4th quartile, 1.32 [1.21–1.44]; test for trend, P{\textless}.001). Significant interactions were shown for HPV vaccination initiation by HOUSES for sex (P=.009) and age (P=.006).

Conclusion:
The study showed disparities in HPV vaccination by SES, with the highest HOUSES quartiles associated with increased rates of initiating and even greater likelihood of completing the series. HOUSES data may be used to target and tailor HPV vaccination interventions to undervaccinated populations.},

	abstract = {In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration expanded the age of eligibility for the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to 27 to 45 years. However, it is unclear if there are racial/ethnic disparities in HPV vaccine uptake for this age-group following this expanded recommendation. We aimed to identify any disparities in HPV vaccine in 27 to 45 year-olds based on sociodemographic factors. We analyzed nationally representative, cross-sectional data from the 2019 National Health Interview Survey (n = 9440). Logistic regression models estimated the odds of vaccine uptake (receipt of ≥1 vaccine dose) based on sociodemographic factors. Participants were mostly Non-Hispanic Whites (60.7\%) and females (50.9\%). In adjusted models, females had over three times greater odds of vaccine uptake compared to males (aOR = 3.58; 95\% CI 3.03, 4.23). Also, compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Non-Hispanic Blacks were 36\% more likely (aOR = 1.36; 95\% CI 1.09, 1.70), and Hispanics were 27\% less likely (aOR = 0.73; 95\% CI 0.58, 0.92) to receive the vaccine. Additionally, individuals without a usual place of care had lower odds of vaccine uptake (aOR = 0.72; 95\% CI 0.57, 0.93), as were those with lower educational levels (aORhigh school = 0.62; 95\% CI 0.50, 0.78; aORsome college = 0.83; 95\% CI 0.70, 0.98). There are disparities in HPV vaccine uptake among 27 to 45 year-olds, and adult Hispanics have lower odds of receiving the vaccine. Given the vaccine’s importance in cancer prevention, it is critical that these disparities are addressed and mitigated.},

	abstract = {Objective: To ascertain the magnitude and potential mechanisms of racial/ethnic disparities in initiating and completing the 3-dose human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among U.S. women in the post-Affordable Care Act era.Design: Using 2015 National Health Interview Survey data, we used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between race/ethnicity and HPV vaccination initiation and completion among black, Latina, Asian, and white U.S. women aged 18-31 years, adjusting for age and geographic region. We also examined the role of socioeconomic and health care factors in potentially explaining racial/ethnic disparities in HPV vaccine uptake and stratified our analyses by age (ages 18-22 and 23-31 years).Results: The prevalence of HPV vaccination initiation and completion among U.S. women aged 18-31 years overall was 35.4\% and 22.7\%, respectively. We observed no statistically significant difference in the odds of HPV vaccination initiation or completion by race/ethnicity among women aged 18-22 years, adjusting for age and geographic region. Among women aged 23-31 years, Latina ([odds ratio=] 0.59; [95\% confidence interval:] 0.47, 0.76) and Asian (0.51; 0.34, 0.75) women had significantly lower adjusted odds of initiating HPV vaccination compared to white women. Further, relative to white women, black (0.46; 0.32, 0.67), Latina (0.45; 0.32, 0.64), and Asian (0.46; 0.28, 0.78) women had significantly lower adjusted odds of completing HPV vaccination. Adding socioeconomic factors to the models attenuated the HPV vaccination initiation adjusted odds ratios for Latina vs. white women and the HPV vaccination completion adjusted odds ratios for both black and Latina vs. white women. The inclusion of health care factors into the models did not further attenuate these odds ratios.Conclusion: Policies and programs that promote socioeconomic equity may mitigate HPV vaccination disparities between black and Latina women and white women. Additional research is needed to identify the drivers of HPV vaccination disparities between subgroups of Asian women and white women.},

	abstract = {Studies disagree about whether racial and ethnic groups have lower or higher human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake, an important issue given large disparities in some HPV cancers. We sought to characterize and explain racial and ethnic differences in HPV vaccination. We systematically searched PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science to identify US studies through mid-2017 reporting associations of race and ethnicity with HPV vaccination. We identified 118 studies (n = 3,095,486) published in English that reported HPV vaccine initiation or follow-through in the US from which we could calculate effect sizes. We used random effects meta-analysis to synthesize effect sizes for comparisons of Whites or non-Hispanics to Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, or all minority groups combined. Studies showed no racial or ethnic differences in HPV vaccine initiation overall. However, when restricting to studies using provider-verified vaccination data, minorities were 6.1\% [3.3\%–8.8\%] more likely than Whites to initiate HPV vaccination. Advantages were larger for Hispanics, males, and younger samples (age {\textless} 18). In contrast, minorities were 8.6\% [5.6\%, 11.7\%], less likely than Whites to follow-through with the full HPV vaccine series, a disparity present across all participant and study characteristics. More recent studies found larger advantages for racial and ethnic minorities in HPV vaccine initiation and smaller disparities in follow-through. In summary, high-quality studies found racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to initiate but less likely to follow-through with HPV vaccination, a clear finding that self-report studies obscure. Higher HPV vaccine initiation among minorities suggests potential reductions in HPV cancer disparities.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Purpose Vaccinations are reported at the state level, but services are delivered at the county level through health departments (HD). This research contributes statistical models to predict county level HPV vaccination. Methods Using a cross sectional study design, secondary data were analyzed for the years 2016–2018 for all counties of GA. Study population was male and female adolescents aged 13–17 who received the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. The number of administered HPV vaccine doses and HPV vaccination coverage rate were modeled using indicators of HD clinic access, age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, median household income, health insurance, and urban/rural residence. Results By county the number of administered HPV vaccine doses showed a statistically significant positive association with indicators of HD clinic access: public transit and the number of HD private clinics. HPV vaccination coverage showed a statistically significant negative association with White race and rural residency. Conclusion Examining Tdap vaccinated adolescents conservatively predicted HPV vaccination and controlled for multiple confounders such as vaccination ineligibility, vaccine exemption, and vaccine opposition. Within this population, public health professionals and clinicians could use these statistical models to target HPV vaccination efforts among non-Hispanic whites and rural communities at the county level.},
